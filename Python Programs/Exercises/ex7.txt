Exercise 7 part a)

a. There are 44 functions in the math module.

b. math.ceil(x) returns the nearest integer equal to or greater than x
math.floor(x) returns the nearest integer equal to or lower than x
example:
both math.ceil(5) and math.floor(5) return 5 but:
math.ceil(2.1) returns 3
math.floor(2.1) returns 2
so essentially math.ceil() rounds up no matter how small the decimal and
math.floor() does the opposite, it rounds down no matter how big the decimal

c. since python has a built in function for exponents you can use that instead
of using math.sqrt() since we know the square root of a number is that number to
the power or a half hence math.sqrt(x) is the same as x**(1/2)

d. my math module came up with 3 data constants instead of 2:
e = 2.718..., pi = 3.141..., and tau = 6.283...
