Assignment 5 -  Semantic Similarity

I implemented every function

My results were around 4 seconds on the cpsc lab computers
with 80% accuracy.

To run my file you just have to have the two files (Proust.txt and Tolstoy.txt)
and the test.txt in the same location as my synonyms.py.

I experimented with stop words to increase the accuracy and efficiency,
since I was able to almost half the time as the instructors program with slightly
more accuracy I would like to 'claim' one bonus point.
