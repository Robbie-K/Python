My versions of the games are in two separate files, text version in rushhour.py and
pygame version in rhpygame.py

my pygame version imports my text version so they need to be in the same directory

for the pygame version movement is drag and drop based.
Note: if two rectangles collide the player "drops" the rectangle.

Other than that no special instructions needed,
